**m2r**
=======

**m2r** is a new R package that provides a persistent connection between [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [Macaulay2](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/).

The package grew out of a collaboration at the [2016 Mathematics Research Community](http://www.ams.org/programs/research-communities/mrc-16), funded by the [National Science Foundation](http://www.nsf.gov) through the [American Mathematical Society](http://www.ams.org/home/page).

It is currently being actively developed, so expect changes. If you have a feature request, please file an issue!

Getting started
---------------

**m2r** is loaded like any other R package:

``` r
library(m2r)
#  Loading required package: mpoly
#  Loading required package: stringr
#    M2 found in /Applications/Macaulay2-1.9.2/bin
```

When loaded, **m2r** initializes a persistent connection to a back-end Macaulay2 session. The basic function in R that accesses this connection is `m2()`, which simply accepts a character string that is run by the Macaulay2 session.

``` r
m2("1 + 1")
#  Starting M2
#  [1] "2"
```

You can see the persistence by setting variables and accessing them across different `m2()` calls:

``` r
m2("a = 1")
#  [1] "1"
m2("a")
#  [1] "1"
```

You can check the variables defined in the M2 session with `m2_ls()`:

``` r
m2_ls()
#   [1] "a"                      "m2o1"                  
#   [3] "m2o2"                   "m2o3"                  
#   [5] "m2o4"                   "m2rintoutline"         
#   [7] "m2rintretcode"          "m2rintruncount"        
#   [9] "m2rintoutclassclass"    "m2rintoutvalsucceeded" 
#  [11] "m2rintinout"            "m2rintinline"          
#  [13] "m2rintoutval"           "m2rintoutlinesucceeded"
#  [15] "m2rintvarname"          "m2rintoutclass"        
#  [17] "m2rintnumlines"
```

You can also check if variables exist with `m2_exists()`:

``` r
m2_exists("a")
#  [1] TRUE
m2_exists(c("a","b"))
#  [1]  TRUE FALSE
```

Notice that there are many variables returned by `m2_ls()` that we didn't make. Most of those are created internally by **m2r** in order to facilitate the connection, so you won't want to access them. Others, however are ok to access directly:

``` r
m2("m2o3")
#  [1] "1"
```

Apart from the basic connection to M2, **m2r** has basic data structures and methods to reference and manipulate the M2 objects within R. These are being actively developed.

Rings, ideals, and Grobner bases
--------------------------------

**m2r** currently has basic support for [rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics)):

``` r
(R <- ring(c("t", "x", "y", "z"), "QQ"))
#  M2 PolynomialRing: QQ[t,x,y,z], grevlex order
```

You can compute [Grobner bases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GrÃ¶bner_basis) as well. The basic function to do this is `gb()`:

``` r
gb("t^4 - x", "t^3 - y", "t^2 - z", ring = R)
#  z^2  -  x
#  z t  -  y
#  -1 z x  +  y^2
#  -1 x  +  t y
#  -1 z y  +  x t
#  -1 z  +  t^2
```

The result is an `mpolyList` object, from the [**mpoly** package](https://github.com/dkahle/mpoly). You can see the M2 code by adding `code = TRUE`:

``` r
gb("t^4 - x", "t^3 - y", "t^2 - z", code = TRUE)
#   gens gb(ideal({t^4-x,t^3-y,t^2-z}), DegreeLimit => {})
```

You can compute the basis respective of different orders as follows. The default ordering is the [grevlex order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomial_order) on the variables given by `mpoly::vars()` applied to the `mpolyList` given by the polynomials.

``` r
R <- ring(c("x","y","t","z"), order = "lex")
gb("t^4 - x", "t^3 - y", "t^2 - z", ring = R)
#  t^2  -  z
#  -1 t z  +  y
#  -1 z^2  +  x
```

`gb()` also accepts `mpoly` objects, like `gb(p1, p2, p3)` where `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are `mpoly` objects (e.g. `p1 <- mp("t^4 - x")`). There is also a [standard evaluation](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Computing-on-the-language.html) version of `gb()` called `gb_()`, which takes in a `mpolyList` object directly.

``` r
(ps <- mp(c("t^4 - x", "t^3 - y", "t^2 - z")))
#  t^4  -  x
#  t^3  -  y
#  t^2  -  z
gb_(ps)
#  t^2  -  z
#  -1 t z  +  y
#  -1 z^2  +  x
```

Factor integers
---------------

``` r
(x <- 2^5 * 3^4 * 5^3 * 7^2 * 11^1)
#  [1] 174636000
factor_n(x)
#    prime power
#  1     2     5
#  2     3     4
#  3     5     3
#  4     7     2
#  5    11     1
```

Factor polynomials
------------------

Smith normal form of a matrix
-----------------------------

The Smith normal form of a matrix *M* here refers to the decomposition of an integer matrix *D = PMQ*, where *D*, *P*, and *Q* are integer matrices and *D* is diagonal. *P* and *Q* are unimodular matrices (their determinants are -1 or 1), so they are invertible. This is somewhat like a singular value decomposition for integer matrices.

``` r
M <- matrix(c(
   2,  4,   4,
  -6,  6,  12,
  10, -4, -16
), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)

(mats <- snf(M))
#  $D
#       [,1] [,2] [,3]
#  [1,]   12    0    0
#  [2,]    0    6    0
#  [3,]    0    0    2
#  
#  $P
#       [,1] [,2] [,3]
#  [1,]    1    0    1
#  [2,]    0    1    0
#  [3,]    0    0    1
#  
#  $Q
#       [,1] [,2] [,3]
#  [1,]    4   -2   -1
#  [2,]   -2    3    1
#  [3,]    3   -2   -1
P <- mats$P; D <- mats$D; Q <- mats$Q

P %*% M %*% Q                # = D
#       [,1] [,2] [,3]
#  [1,]   12    0    0
#  [2,]    0    6    0
#  [3,]    0    0    2
solve(P) %*% D %*% solve(Q)  # = M
#       [,1] [,2] [,3]
#  [1,]    2    4    4
#  [2,]   -6    6   12
#  [3,]   10   -4  -16

det(P)
#  [1] 1
det(Q)
#  [1] -1
```

**m2r** internals: pointers and pointer functions
-------------------------------------------------

At a basic level, **m2r** works by passing strings between R and M2. Originating at the R side, these strings are properly formated M2 code constructed from the inputs to the R functions. That code goes to M2, is evaluated there, and then "exported" with M2's function `toExternalString()`. The resulting string often, but not always, produces the M2 code needed to recreate the object resulting from the evaluation, and in that sense is M2's version of R's `dput()`. That string is passed back into R and parsed there into R-style data structures, typically S3-classed lists.

The R-side parsing of the external string from M2 is an expensive process because it is currently implemented in R (as opposed to C++). Consequently (and for other reasons, too!), in some cases you'll want to do a M2 computation from R, but leave the output in M2. Since you will ultimately want something in R referring to the result, nearly every **m2r** function that performs M2 computations as a pointer version. As a simple naming convention, the function that returns the pointer, called the reference function, is determined by the ordinary function, called the value function, by appending a `.`.

For example, we've seen that `factor_n()` computes the prime decomposition of a number. The corresponding reference function is `factor_n.()`:

``` r
(x <- 2^5 * 3^4 * 5^3 * 7^2 * 11^1)
#  [1] 174636000
factor_n.(x)
#  M2 Pointer Object
#    ExternalString : new Product from {new Power from {2,5},new Power fro...
#           M2 Name : m2o127
#          M2 Class : Product (WrapperType)
factor_n.(x)$ext_str
#  [1] "new Product from {new Power from {2,5},new Power from {3,4},new Power from {5,3},new Power from {7,2},new Power from {11,1}}"
```

All value functions simply wrap reference functions and parse the output with `m2_parse()`, a general M2 parser, often with little more parsing:

``` r
factor_n
#  function (n, code = FALSE, gmp = FALSE, ...) {
#  
#    # run m2
#    args <- as.list(match.call())[-1]
#    eargs <- lapply(args, eval, envir = parent.frame())
#    pointer <- do.call(factor_n., eargs)
#    if(code) return(invisible(pointer))
#  
#    # parse output
#    parsed_out <- m2_parse(pointer)
#  
#    # reformat
#    df <- as.data.frame(matrix(unlist(parsed_out), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE))
#    names(df) <- c("prime", "power")
#  
#    # return
#    df
#  }
#  <environment: namespace:m2r>
```

Creating your own **m2r** wrapper
---------------------------------

To create your own wrapper function of something in Macaulay2, you'll need to create an R file that looks like the one below. This will create both value (e.g. `f`) and reference/pointer (e.g. `f.`) versions of the function. As a good example of these at work, see the scripts for [`factor_n()`](https://github.com/musicman3320/m2r/blob/master/R/factor_n.R) or [`factor_poly()`](https://github.com/musicman3320/m2r/blob/master/R/factor_poly.R).

  # run m2
  args <- as.list(match.call())[-1]
  eargs <- lapply(args, eval, envir = parent.frame())
  pointer <- do.call(f., eargs)
  if(code) return(invisible(pointer))

  # parse output
  parsed_out <- m2_parse(pointer)

  # more parsing
  TRUE

  # return
  TRUE

}




# reference version of f (returns pointer to m2 object)
#' @rdname f
#' @export
f. <- function(esntl_parm_1, esntl_parm_2, code = FALSE, ...) {

  # basic arg checking
  TRUE

  # create essential parameters to pass to m2 this step regularizes input to m2, so it
  # is the one that deals with pointers, chars, rings, ideals, mpolyLists, etc.
  TRUE

  # construct m2_code from regularized essential parameters
  TRUE

  # message
  if(code) { message(m2_code); return(invisible(m2_code)) }

  # run m2 and return pointer
  m2.(m2_code)

}
```
