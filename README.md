**m2r**
=======

**m2r** is a very new R package that provides a persistent connection between [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [Macaulay2](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/).

The package grew out of a collaboration at the [2016 Mathematics Research Community](http://www.ams.org/programs/research-communities/mrc-16), funded by the [National Science Foundation](http://www.nsf.gov) through the [American Mathematical Society](http://www.ams.org/home/page).

It is currently being actively developed, so expect changes. If you have a feature request, please file an issue!

Getting started
---------------

**m2r** is loaded like any other R package:

``` r
library(m2r)
#> Loading required package: mpoly
#> Loading required package: stringr
#>   M2 found in /Applications/Macaulay2-1.5/bin
```

When loaded, **m2r** initializes a persistent connection to a back-end Macaulay2 session. The basic function in R that accesses this connection is `m2()`, which simply accepts a character string that is run by the Macaulay2 session.

``` r
m2("1 + 1")
#> Starting M2
#> [1] "2"
```

You can see the persistence by setting variables and accessing them across different `m2()` calls:

``` r
m2("a = 1")
#> [1] "1"
m2("a")
#> [1] "1"
```

Apart from the basic connection to M2, **m2r** has basic data structures and methods to reference and manipulate the M2 objects within R. These are being actively developed.

Rings, ideals, and Grobner bases
--------------------------------

**m2r** currently has basic support for [rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics)):

``` r
R <- ring(c("x", "y", "z"))
R
#> M2 PolynomialRing: CC[x,y,z], grevlex order
str_m2(R)
#> M2 Object
#>     Type : PolynomialRing
#>   R Name : R
#>  M2 Name : m2rintring00000001
#>     Vars : x, y, z
#>    Order : grevlex
```

You can compute [Grobner bases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GrÃ¶bner_basis) as well. The basic function to do this is `gb()`:

``` r
gb("t^4 - x", "t^3 - y", "t^2 - z")
#> z^2  -  x
#> z t  -  y
#> -1 z x  +  y^2
#> -1 x  +  t y
#> -1 z y  +  x t
#> -1 z  +  t^2
```

The result is an `mpolyList` object, from the [**mpoly** package](https://github.com/dkahle/mpoly). You can see the M2 code by adding `code = TRUE`:

``` r
gb("t^4 - x", "t^3 - y", "t^2 - z", code = TRUE)
#> R := QQ[t,x,y,z]
#> I := ideal(t^4  -  x, t^3  -  y, t^2  -  z)
#> gens gb I
#> z^2  -  x
#> z t  -  y
#> -1 z x  +  y^2
#> -1 x  +  t y
#> -1 z y  +  x t
#> -1 z  +  t^2
```

You can compute the basis respective of different orders as follows. The default ordering is the [grevlex order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomial_order) on the variables given by `mpoly::vars()` applied to the `mpolyList` given by the polynomials.

``` r
R <- ring(c("x","y","t","z"), order = "lex")
gb("t^4 - x", "t^3 - y", "t^2 - z", ring = R)
#> t^2  -  z
#> -1 t z  +  y
#> -1 z^2  +  x
```

`gb()` also accepts `mpoly` objects, like `gb(p1, p2, p3)` where `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are `mpoly` objects (e.g. `p1 <- mp("t^4 - x")`). There is also a [standard evaluation](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Computing-on-the-language.html) version of `gb()` called `gb_()`, which takes in a `mpolyList` object directly.

``` r
(ps <- mp(c("t^4 - x", "t^3 - y", "t^2 - z")))
#> t^4  -  x
#> t^3  -  y
#> t^2  -  z
gb_(ps)
#> z^2  -  x
#> z t  -  y
#> -1 z x  +  y^2
#> -1 x  +  t y
#> -1 z y  +  x t
#> -1 z  +  t^2
```

Additional features
-------------------

### Factor integers

``` r
(x <- 2^5 * 3^4 * 5^3 * 7^2 * 11^1)
#> [1] 174636000
factor_n(x)
#>      prime power
#> [1,]     2     5
#> [2,]     3     4
#> [3,]     5     3
#> [4,]     7     2
#> [5,]    11     1
```

### Smith normal form of a matrix

The Smith normal form of a matrix *M* here refers to the decomposition of an integer matrix *D = PMQ*, where *D*, *P*, and *Q* are integer matrices and *D* is diagonal. *P* and *Q* are unimodular matrices (their determinants are -1 or 1), so they are invertible. This is somewhat like a singular value decomposition for integer matrices.

``` r
M <- matrix(c(
   2,  4,   4,
  -6,  6,  12,
  10, -4, -16
), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)

(mats <- snf(M))
#> $D
#>      [,1] [,2] [,3]
#> [1,]   12    0    0
#> [2,]    0    6    0
#> [3,]    0    0    2
#> 
#> $Q
#>      [,1] [,2] [,3]
#> [1,]    2    1    1
#> [2,]    0    1    0
#> [3,]   -1    0    0
#> 
#> $P
#>      [,1] [,2] [,3]
#> [1,]   -3    4    3
#> [2,]   -1    3    2
#> [3,]    2   -3   -2
P <- mats$P; D <- mats$D; Q <- mats$Q

P %*% M %*% Q                # = D
#>      [,1] [,2] [,3]
#> [1,]   12    0    0
#> [2,]    0    6    0
#> [3,]    0    0    2
solve(P) %*% D %*% solve(Q)  # = M
#>      [,1] [,2] [,3]
#> [1,]    2    4    4
#> [2,]   -6    6   12
#> [3,]   10   -4  -16

det(P)
#> [1] -1
det(Q)
#> [1] 1
```

Installation
------------

Here's how you can install this *very developmental* version of **m2r**. Remember you need to have [Macaulay2](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/) downloaded; **m2r** will look for it in your path variable (in the terminal, `echo $PATH`) as set by `~/.bash_profile` or, if nonexistent, then `~/.bashrc`, then `~/.profile`.

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("musicman3320/m2r")
```
